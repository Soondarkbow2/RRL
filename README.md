# RRL2epub

As the title and description suggests, this is a program to convert RoyalRoadL fictions into Epub files. Specifically, this tool converts them into EPUB 3.

##Usage

Use of this program is simple. Using a terminal, go to the directory of the binary and then use the following command:

    ./RRL2epub 4565

Of course, replace the number with the ID of any fiction on the site. (Just look at the URL)

If you have the binary in your PATH, go to the directory you wish to download the EPUB to, and use the same command without the `./` at the start.
